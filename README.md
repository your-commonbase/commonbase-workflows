# CommonBase Workflows

This repository is called by all other services workflows to simply tag the private [Commonbase-Helm](https://github.com/your-commonbase/commonbase-helm) repository for release to either the development or production Kubernetes clusters.

This repository must remain public so that it is discoverable and usable by other services Github Workflows.
